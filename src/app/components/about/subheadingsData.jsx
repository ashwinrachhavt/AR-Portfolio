          <p>
        I am a Master&apos;s student majoring in Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I have a passion for building, scaling, maintaining, and perusing intelligent systems that have sprung from the fields of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and principles of Software Engineering with their presence in real-world settings.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I have an extensive work experience at three companies - Unar Labs - Portland Maine, Outreach Corporation Seattle Washington, and Mindbowser Inc Pune, India.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I played a pivotal role most recently at UnarLabs LLC as a Machine Learning Engineer developing a new backend system for
         which enhanced multisensory information access for visually impaired individuals. My responsibilities included architecting and optimizing data pipelines for tasks like data preprocessing, model training, and inference. 
         I leveraged various frameworks such as OpenCV, PyTorch, Transformers, and FastAPI, along with technologies like Distributed Servers, Docker, GCP, and HuggingFace. 
         This comprehensive approach allowed me to engage in full-stack data science and contribute significantly to the project&apos;s success.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>

        During my internship at Outreach Corporation, I developed a template engine project to streamline the deployment of NLP models for Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers. This involved building a complex Inference Service Solution for models like BERT, ROBERTA, and DistilBERT in ONNX format, along with a Golang-based Microservice for real-time predictions. I also conducted testing using CircleCI, dockerized both solutions, and managed deployment with Kubernetes. This experience expanded my technical skill set and introduced me to a collaborative team of industry professionals.
