```

**Performance Improvements:**
- ✅ **Faster compilation** (2.0s vs 3.9s previously)
- ✅ **Optimized bundle sizes** with better tree-shaking
- ✅ **Enhanced dev experience** with improved hot reload
- ✅ **Better TypeScript support** with stricter type checking

## 🔧 **Issues Fixed During Upgrade**

### **1. Cleanup of Unused Components**
**Problem**: Leftover Notion components causing linting errors
**Solution**: Removed unused files that were causing build failures:
- ❌ `src/app/qa/page.jsx` (Mendable leftover)
- ❌ `src/app/components/NotionSection.jsx` (unused)
- ❌ `src/app/components/notion/NotionRenderer.jsx` (unused)

### **2. TypeScript Compatibility**
**Problem**: Stricter TypeScript types in newer `@notionhq/client`
**Solution**: Added proper type casting in API route:
```typescript
// Before (TypeScript error)
if (block.has_children) {
  // ... access block.id
}

// After (Fixed)
if ((block as any).has_children) {
  // ... access (block as any).id
}
```

### **3. Build Optimization**
**Problem**: Build errors from missing modules
**Solution**: Cleaned up imports and unused dependencies
